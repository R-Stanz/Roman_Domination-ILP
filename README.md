Roman_Domination-ILP
===

General Description
---
This repository is made thinking on analyzing the solving of the roman domination problem with integer linear programming and mixed integer linear programming approaches. 
<p>
In order to achieve it, we are going to use the Google OR tools on python 3 to solve the linear models generated that will help to analyze the performance of the selected approaches.


Technologies
---

It's been used the followed technologies:

|Name|Version|
|---|---|
|Python 3|3.10.12|
|Jupyter Notebook|7.1.1|
|MatPlotLib|3.8.2|
|NetworkX|3.3|
|Pandas|2.2.1|


Theoretical Approaches
---

For the integer linear programming it's been used the ReVelle and Rosing formulation. [^1]
<p> 
For the mixed integer linear programming it's been used the improved version proposed by Marija Ivanovic. [^2]
